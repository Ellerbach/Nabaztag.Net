# Nabaztag.Net to have a full interaction with the pynab service

The aim of this project is to fully interact with the [pynab service](https://github.com/nabaztag2018/pynab).

This library is under development. As you can't deploy .NET Core application on the Raspeberry Pi zero, you need to deploy it somewhere on your network and make sure your rabbit will listen to request coming from outside of it's body :-) See [here how setup the connection](https://github.com/nabaztag2018/pynab/issues/101)

# TODO

- create documentation
- add more interaction with pynab (so far onlye sleep and wake up available)
- improve the simulator
- add more tests
